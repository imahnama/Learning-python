# Tuples are a sequence data types
# It consists of a number of values separated by commas
# Tuples can hold diff types of data types
# They are immutable - cannot be added new items

T = (1, 2, 3, 4)
print(len(T)) # print length of the Tuple

# concatenation
Z = T + (5,5)
print(Z)

#slicing
print (Z[1])

#Tuples also have callable methods

Y = 'nama', 3.0, [1, 2, 3]
